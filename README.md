THINGS TO DO:
Collections:
contained in App as state- has updating functions but nowhere to display(shopping cart, change icon)
user input needed when making new collection for the name

Gallery:
performance improvements- large images means slow loading
shimmer loading

Artwork:
direct click on the selected and current should go to museum website

General:
move switch button to the selected Image
put a collectionAdder by the selected image that adds that image
possibly changing name, layout- too much blank space
suggested in meeting to add search
make museum an option?
